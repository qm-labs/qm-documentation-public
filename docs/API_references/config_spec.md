# Configuration Specification

The complete specification of the configuration schema can be found [here](../../assets/qua_config.html).

!!! Note
    The config specification is in beta mode, and has the following issues:

    1. The type field does not represent the true type field, where this is relevant the type has been given in parentheses
    2. in `element` schema, only one of mixInputs/singleInput can be selected.
