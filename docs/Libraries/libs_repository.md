# QUA libraries repository

In [QUA libraries repository](https://github.com/qua-platform/qua-libs) you can find many relevant tutorials and a lot of examples that will boost your QUA expertise and help you realize your experiments.

The repository consists of two sections:

* The ["Tutorials"](https://github.com/qua-platform/qua-libs/tree/main/Tutorials) folder contains various tutorials and guides for working with the OPX.

* The ["Quantum Control Applications"](https://github.com/qua-platform/qua-libs/tree/main/Quantum-Control-Applications) 
  folder contains scripts and examples for different qubits types, all the way from basic to advanced protocols. 
  It also includes various examples and results from leading labs.

!!! Note
    
    Many of the scripts and examples in the repository use the [QUA tools repository](tools_repository.md), which makes the QUA program more efficient and easy to write.
    It is thus advised to download the last version.
